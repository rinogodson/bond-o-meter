# Bond-o-Meter
This is a playful method that estimates the romantic compatibility between 2 individuals based on their names. This method is intended for entertainment and should not be taken as a serious measure of compatibility. It is kinda like FLAMES but more advanced. The algorithm used is [here](https://github.com/rinogodson/bond-o-meter/blob/master/Algorithm.md).
